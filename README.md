# Day 67 Advanced blog capstone project part 4

This is the final part of the blog website project. I am responsible for the backend development of this website. 
Today was about adding multiple users, authentication, Protecting routes and adding comments to the posts.

These tasks required making one-to-many relationships between tables. Making a decorator 
function so only the admin can have access to certain routes.
